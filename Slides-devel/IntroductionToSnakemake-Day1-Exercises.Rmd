# Exercise 1

## Setting up Computer environment

For warming up, please login to Puhti, navigate to the project scratch space (`/scratch/project_200XXXX`)

```{bash}
cd /scratch/project_200XXX
```

There, create a subfolder with your username

```{bash}
mkdir $USER
```

Activate the snakemake functionality (remember, it was part of the bioconda module)

```{bash}
module load bioconda/3
```

And test, if snakemake is available for you (e.g. by printing the version)

```{bash}
snakemake --version
```

# Exercise 2

## Own "Hello-World"

Create your own "Hello-World" workflow and run it.

The workflow file called `hello-world.smk` should contain something similar to this:

```{bash}
rule all:
    input: "hello-world.txt"
    
rule say_hello:
    output: "hello-world.txt"
    shell:"""
    echo 'Hello World!!!' > {output}
    """
```

And you can run it with this shell command

```{bash}
snakemake --cores 1  --snakefile hello-world.smk
```

## Create a two-stage workflow

This is a more advanced step. We learned, that Snakemake rules consist out of input, output and shell directives and that they can be thought of dependency graphs. The input of one rule should be the output of another rule.

In the next exercise, I would like you to think about a two-staged workflow. One example could be for example that you first create the file "hello-world" and in the next step/rule, you would take this file and translate the content to upper case, e.g. using this command:

`tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' < hello-world.txt > HELLO-WORLD.txt`

Remember to use a rule `all` that contains the final file you want to receive and also to use `{input}` and `{output}` curly bracket notations in your `shell` directive.

The complete workflow would look e.g. like this:

```{python}
rule all:
    input: "HELLO-WORLD.txt"

rule say_hello:
    output: "hello-world.txt"
    shell:"""
    echo 'Hello World!!!' > hello-world.txt
    """

rule capitalise:
    input: "hello-world.txt"
    output: "HELLO-WORLD.txt"
    shell:"""
    tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' < {input} > {output}
    """
```

# Exercise 3

## Download the exercise data
Run the bioinformatics example also for sample B and C. For that, we need to do a few things first. First, download the data into your user project folder that you created earlier, using these commands:

`cd /scratch/project_200XXX/$USER`

`wget https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-tutorial-data/archive/v5.4.5.tar.gz`

`tar --wildcards -xf v5.4.5.tar.gz --strip 1 "*/data"`

and then we need to make bwa and samtools available via the module system like this

`module load gcc/9.1.0`

`module load bwa/0.7.17`

`module load samtools`

## Align B.fastq
In the slides, we had the workflow that aligns the data for the sample A.fastq. Now, try to adjust the script such, that you can align B.fastq.

The workflow look like this:

```{python}
rule bwa_map:
    input:
        "data/genome.fa",
        "data/samples/B.fastq"
    output:
        "mapped_reads/B.bam"
    shell:
        "bwa mem {input} | samtools view -Sb - > {output}"
```

and the bash command to run the workflow like this:

```{bash}
snakemake -c1 -s bwa_align.smk mapped_reads/B.bam
```

# Exercise 4

Adjust your alignment script also such, that you use wildcards (`{sample}`) instead of hard-coded filenames and run the alignemtn for all three samples A,B and C.

The adjusted script would look like this:

````{python}
rule bwa_map:
    input:
        "data/genome.fa",
        "data/samples/{sample}.fastq"
    output:
        "mapped_reads/{sample}.bam"
    shell:
        "bwa mem {input} | samtools view -Sb - > {output}"
```

and the bash command to start the workflow,looks e.g. like this:

```{bash}
snakemake -c1 -s bwa_align.smk mapped_reads/{A,B,C}.bam
```

After you prepared the three bam files, try to rerun the workflow again and check what Snakemake does.

That is what it will look like:

```{bash}
Building DAG of jobs...
Nothing to be done.
Complete log: /users/fischerd/tmp/fischerd/.snakemake/log/2022-06-01T135131.623828.snakemake.log
```

However, now assume that one of the input files was changed. You can simulate this, by 'touching' it like this:

`touch /scratch/project_200XXX/$USER/data/A.fastq`

Try to do that and rerun then the pipeline again.

# Exercise 5
First, add the sorting and indexing step to your workflow file.

It will look then like this:

```{bash}
rule bwa_map:
    input:
        "data/genome.fa",
        "data/samples/{sample}.fastq"
    output:
        "mapped_reads/{sample}.bam"
    shell:
        "bwa mem {input} | samtools view -Sb - > {output}"

rule samtools_sort:
    input:
        "mapped_reads/{sample}.bam"
    output:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam"
    shell:"""
      samtools sort -T sorted_reads/{wildcards.sample} \
               -O bam {input} > {output}
    """

rule samtools_index:
    input:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam"
    output:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam.bai"
    shell:
        "samtools index {input}"
```

Then prepare the DAG.

```{bash}
snakemake --dag -s bwa_align.smk sorted_reads/{A,B,C}.bam.bai | dot -Tsvg > dag.svg
```

And also the rulegraph

```{bash}
snakemake --rulegraph -s bwa_align.smk sorted_reads/{A,B,C}.bam.bai | dot -Tsvg > rulegraph.svg
```

as well as a dry-run (remember to delete files that have been generated already beforehand, in case it does not want to do anything)

```{bash}
snakemake -s bwa_align.smk sorted_reads/{A,B,C}.bam.bai -np
```

# Exercise 6

Add the variant calling step. Where do you need to define the `SAMPLES` object? What target rule do you need to give to the call?

Before executing your code, do a dry-run and create the rulegraph and dag!

The workflow would look like this:

```{python}
SAMPLES = ["A", "B"]

rule bwa_map:
    input:
        "data/genome.fa",
        "data/samples/{sample}.fastq"
    output:
        "mapped_reads/{sample}.bam"
    shell:
        "bwa mem {input} | samtools view -Sb - > {output}"

rule samtools_sort:
    input:
        "mapped_reads/{sample}.bam"
    output:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam"
    shell:"""
      samtools sort -T sorted_reads/{wildcards.sample} \
               -O bam {input} > {output}
    """

rule samtools_index:
    input:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam"
    output:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam.bai"
    shell:
        "samtools index {input}"

rule bcftools_call:
    input:
        fa="data/genome.fa",
        bam=expand("sorted_reads/{sample}.bam", sample=SAMPLES),
        bai=expand("sorted_reads/{sample}.bam.bai", sample=SAMPLES)
    output:
        "calls/all.vcf"
    shell:
        "bcftools mpileup -f {input.fa} {input.bam} | "
        "bcftools call -mv - > {output}"
```

And you can do the dry-run by running

```{bash}
snakemake -s bwa_align.smk calls/all.vcf -np
```

and the rulegraph like this

```{bash}
snakemake --rulegraph -s bwa_align.smk calls/all.vcf | dot -Tsvg > rulegraph_vcf.svg
snakemake --dag -s bwa_align.smk calls/all.vcf | dot -Tsvg > dag_vcf.svg
```

# Exercise 7
Add your own script file (like the quality histogram) to your workflow and rerun it to create the figure.

The full workflow will look like this

```{python}
SAMPLES = ["A", "B"]

rule bwa_map:
    input:
        "data/genome.fa",
        "data/samples/{sample}.fastq"
    output:
        "mapped_reads/{sample}.bam"
    shell:
        "bwa mem {input} | samtools view -Sb - > {output}"

rule samtools_sort:
    input:
        "mapped_reads/{sample}.bam"
    output:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam"
    shell:"""
      samtools sort -T sorted_reads/{wildcards.sample} \
               -O bam {input} > {output}
    """

rule samtools_index:
    input:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam"
    output:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam.bai"
    shell:
        "samtools index {input}"

rule bcftools_call:
    input:
        fa="data/genome.fa",
        bam=expand("sorted_reads/{sample}.bam", sample=SAMPLES),
        bai=expand("sorted_reads/{sample}.bam.bai", sample=SAMPLES)
    output:
        "calls/all.vcf"
    shell:
        "bcftools mpileup -f {input.fa} {input.bam} | "
        "bcftools call -mv - > {output}"

rule plot_quals:
    input:
        "calls/all.vcf"
    output:
        "plots/quals.svg"
    script:
        "scripts/plot-quals.py"
```

and you can start it with

```{bash}
snakemake -c1 -s bwa_align.smk plots/quals.svg
```

Again, create also a dag-plot for the workflow

```{bash}
snakemake --dag -s bwa_align.smk plots/quals.svg | dot -Tsvg > all.svg
```

# Exercise 8
Add the target rule `all` to the workflow and rerun the pipeline using it

This is how the complete workflow look like now:
```{python}
SAMPLES = ["A", "B"]

rule all:
    input:
        "plots/quals.svg"

rule bwa_map:
    input:
        "data/genome.fa",
        "data/samples/{sample}.fastq"
    output:
        "mapped_reads/{sample}.bam"
    shell:
        "bwa mem {input} | samtools view -Sb - > {output}"

rule samtools_sort:
    input:
        "mapped_reads/{sample}.bam"
    output:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam"
    shell:"""
      samtools sort -T sorted_reads/{wildcards.sample} \
               -O bam {input} > {output}
    """

rule samtools_index:
    input:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam"
    output:
        "sorted_reads/{sample}.bam.bai"
    shell:
        "samtools index {input}"

rule bcftools_call:
    input:
        fa="data/genome.fa",
        bam=expand("sorted_reads/{sample}.bam", sample=SAMPLES),
        bai=expand("sorted_reads/{sample}.bam.bai", sample=SAMPLES)
    output:
        "calls/all.vcf"
    shell:
        "bcftools mpileup -f {input.fa} {input.bam} | "
        "bcftools call -mv - > {output}"

rule plot_quals:
    input:
        "calls/all.vcf"
    output:
        "plots/quals.svg"
    script:
        "scripts/plot-quals.py"
``` 

and we can run this workflow now such that all rules are execute by typing

```{bash}
snakemake -c1 -s bwa_align.smk
```
